Warlock Specializations, and the kinds of Warlock.

Two axes, and a Character carries one of each.  The Specialization is who the
pact is *with*.  The Casting Variant is what the pact answers *to*, and it is
deliberately rare: a table that has never met one can play the published
Warlock forever and never notice it exists.

# Julio's, 2026-08-21.  The organising idea is **spectacle rather than
# cruelty**, which is how this one buys the alignment-independence the Fiend
# buys with toxicity and the Celestial with instrumentality.  Nobody here is
# wicked.  You are being watched, and kept alive for the third act.
#
# They are made of dream and they are bored of it, because nothing in a dream
# was ever actually at risk.  You can lose.  That is the whole attraction, and
# it is the one thing they cannot supply themselves.  So the power is not a
# reward, it is apparatus: they handed over what they had in order to see what
# you would do while holding it.  The test that follows is aesthetic and not
# moral, which is the cruelty of it.  Do the task and you may still fail.  Fail
# and you may still pass, if it was worth watching.
#
# **Why this one is in verse.**  Shakespeare's fairies have their own meter:
# the mortals in A Midsummer Night's Dream speak blank verse, and the moment
# you cross into the wood the fairies drop into short rhymed lines.  The change
# of form *is* the crossing, so the Archfey being the only patron written as a
# poem is the device rather than an inconsistency.  The meter is trochaic
# tetrameter, which is Puck's epilogue and also the witches in Macbeth, so the
# form itself carries the Fae/Fata point: Titania and Baba Yaga speak in one
# rhythm.  See Documenta/Canon/Elves-and-the-Dreaming.md.
#
# Every line is end-stopped on purpose.  A charm does not enjamb.
#
# The closing couplet answers Puck, who says "Think but this, and all is
# mended" at the *end* of the play, which is why it sits at the end here.  This
# one refuses the apology.  And "we shadows" is not modesty: Fae, Fata and
# Shadow are three mortal names for one substance, so the patron is being
# literal and the mortal will hear poetry.  Used once, and never explained.
#
# Four things worth not "fixing":
#   "Power was the dream you had"   doubled, because they *are* dream
#   "a witch would hold"            Yubaba, so Fae and Fata share one quatrain
#   "We shall never see quite where"  they lose sight of you: the only privacy
#                                     in the poem, and the only thing not given
#   "make an end"                   an ending, and your ending, at once
#
# The four wishes are Arthur, Ofelia, Chihiro and Peter, none of them named.
#
# Breaks are explicit per Documenta/Canon/Feature-Text.md.  Nothing may reflow
# this, and a renderer that inserts its own breaks would destroy the couplets.

# Julio's, 2026-08-21.  The organising idea is **instrumentality rather than
# evil**, and it buys the same alignment-independence the Fiend buys with
# toxicity rather than malice.  The patron here is genuinely good and the
# arrangement is still uncomfortable, because the discomfort lives in the
# terms rather than in anyone's intent.
#
# A Celestial is an Ideal with a shape (AtlasActorLudi/SpeciesKit/Aasimar/
# Map_of_Ideals.py), so it is not a god, has no cult, and cannot want a
# worshipper.  What it *can* want is somebody permitted to be inconsistent:
# Justice itself cannot lie to a guard or take the shortcut, and you can.
# Three things are being bought, and none of them is virtue: expendability,
# deniability, and access to ground where it has no invitation.
#
# The voice is deliberately not the Fiend's.  That one is interior and
# solitary, one person alone with a crack nobody else can see.  This one is a
# briefing, given by a superior in the Men In White who is containing his
# tongue, which is why "pusillanimous" stands where a swear would.  The first
# person plural is the device the Species descriptions already use (Dragonborn,
# Tiefling, Goliath): the community talking to the character.  Here the
# community is the other operatives, and that crew is what keeps this register
# adventure rather than nightmare.
#
# Two jokes that are not errors.  "High cloud" is "high horse", and it lands
# because they are stars and planets rather than cloud-dwellers, so it calls
# them the postcard version of themselves.  "The one you crossed" is doubled:
# to cross somebody, and the cross you would talk to them with.
#
# The two ellipses are the same man twice.  The first trails off a list he
# cannot be bothered to finish, the second trails off the one thing he cannot
# actually promise, and "At least try" is him settling for less out loud.
#
# The rules were read for this, and every signature feature is a fund you
# administer on somebody else's behalf:
#   Healing Light         a metered pool, spent as a Bonus Action on others
#   Celestial Resilience  temporary Hit Points handed to five other creatures
#   Searing Vengeance     saves someone else, blinds whoever is standing near
#   Radiant Soul          the Fiend's own fire, differently branded
# The Fiend consumes what is nearest and rises.  The Celestial is a conduit,
# and a conduit keeps nothing.
#
# The opening list is four long to match the Aasimar's own, which reads
# "Angels, Muses, Constellations, Celestials..." (AtlasActorLudi/SpeciesKit/
# Aasimar/__init__.py).  Sphinxes are deliberately *not* in it even though a
# patron can be drawn as one: the ellipsis says there are more nobody bothers
# to name, and it is better if the sheet then names one of them.

	"is not a blessing, it is the standard kit they issue. You do what "
	"they say, but they never tell you how. The right thing, done the "
	"wrong way. You know why. They will tell the one you crossed that it "

	"to redemption. Somewhere there is a balance with your heart on one "

	Bag, which is seeded from the Character rather than from call order, so
	the paragraph names the same patron every time it renders.

	The Ideal is deliberately not printed as a doctrine, the same way the
	Aasimar's mark never prints it: you know who hired you, you do not know
	what they are for.  Which is also the joke the ending turns on, since

# Julio's, 2026-08-19.  The organising idea is a **symmetry**: the crack in
# yourself you refuse to look at is the same crack that opens onto hell.  One
# flaw, two sides.
#
# What that buys is **toxicity rather than malice**, which is why this sits on
# any alignment without contradiction.  A Lawful Good Fiend warlock is still
# extracting: they take risks, other people absorb them, and the two "Maybe"
# lines are the character arguing his own case, because nobody carrying an
# unmanaged flaw believes they are the villain.  They believe they are owed.
#
# The rules were read for this, and they say the same thing:
#   Dark One's Blessing   things die near you and you are topped up
#   Dark One's Own Luck   a d10 out of nowhere, and luck is zero-sum
#   the fire spell list   flames and brimstone, and fire burns what is nearest
#   Hurl Through Hell     a door in you, and someone else always goes through
#
# One deliberate tense clash, which is not an error: "Not what you **need**,
# but what you truly **wanted**."  The wanting was settled in the past by the
# pact.  The need is present because the wound is still open and looking at it
# is the thing that would heal it.  That is the seed of an arc through play,

# Julio's, 2026-08-21.  Two words, and the shortest description in the project
# by an order of magnitude.  That is the argument: across the four patrons the
# form itself contracts toward silence.  The Fiend gets a paragraph, the
# Celestial a longer one, the Archfey twenty lines of verse, and this one says
# everything it has to say and stops.
#
# **The description is not the text, it is what the text does.**  The letters
# are periodically replaced, one at a time, by alchemical, planetary and
# mathematical glyphs, and then they come back.  Nothing is ever permanently
# wrong, so the reader cannot check, which is the whole effect: the horror is
# that you are not certain you saw it.  The rules underwrite this exactly.
# Thought Shield does not arrive until level 10, so from 3 to 9 the character's
# thoughts *can* be read and the sheet never says by whom, and Modify Memory
# sits on the level 9 list, which means "it changed and you did not notice" is
# the subclass's own spell rather than a trick we invented.
#
# Alignment-independence, completing the set: the Fiend buys it with toxicity
# rather than malice, the Celestial with instrumentality rather than evil, the
# Archfey with spectacle rather than cruelty, and this one with **indifference
# rather than hostility**.  Nothing here wants to hurt you.  It has simply
# already finished deciding.
#
# "You, mine." has no verb, and the missing verb is the point.  It is not a
# threat and not an offer, it is a label, stated as something already true.
# And it addresses the *player*, not the character: this is the only patron
# that can, because Awakened Mind is telepathy and Detect Thoughts is on the
# list, and it is the only one that ever will.
#
# The glyph pools are plain Unicode rather than a webfont, which was deliberate:
# a general standard is a better dependency than a CDN, and on machines that
# cannot render a glyph the failure is the effect rather than a defect.
# Alchemical lives in Plane 1 and its coverage genuinely varies, so the same
# sheet resolves differently for different players and nobody can compare
# notes.  Rate and hold are slow on purpose (one per second, held 280ms): this
# patron is asleep, and it is not in a hurry about you.
#
# The span is what makes this explicit rather than inferred, per
# Documenta/Canon/Feature-Text.md.  The source declares which text is affected;
# app/static/js/eldritch.js decides what affected means.  The original letters
# are never removed from the document, only painted over, so copy-paste,
# find-in-page and screen readers all still see "You, mine."
