# Morality, because the split it models is methodological rather than moral:
# the Order subordinates the self to keep a shared thing standing, the
# individual exalts the self and answers to nobody, and the third refuses both
# readings. The two source manuals in Documenta/Sources/Jedi are the argument
# for it in their very form. One is a single Code in a single voice. The other
# is six authors bound into one volume who agree on nothing, and its compiler
# says so in the preface.
#
# Neutral is the unmarked absence of an Order Tag, so it is the default branch
# rather than a third case. Across 120 generated Characters the split runs
# roughly 38 / 24 / 38, so all three are load-bearing.
