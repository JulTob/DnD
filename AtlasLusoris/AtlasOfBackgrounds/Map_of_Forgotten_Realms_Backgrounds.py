Your Master initiated you and brought you into a secret world ruled by dragons hiding under the surface. A balance of power and secrets, of ciphers and covert operations. It is the Master's will that sends you out into the next mission, chasing rumors and errands others would never understand. The great powers of this world are seldom what they appear, but you know a truth worth keeping: someday you will become your own Master.\n"

			'**Secrets of the Dragon Master.** You are initiated into a secret organization that follows a powerful Dragon. But where most people picture a gigantic lizard, you know better: Dragons walk among mortals, wearing humanoid bodies and beautiful visages, playing a never-ending game of chess with the peoples of the realm. You are just a pawn, but you can access the vast knowledge of your Draconic Master. Through a cryptic ritual meditation, you may contact your Master (or other initiated cultists you have met in person) and consult their knowledge. Information is precious and hazardous, so you may not yet be ready to learn every secret, but you know the Cult is focused, above all, on other Dragons: their whereabouts, their hoards, their lairs, their humanoid identities... Your responsibilities to your Draconic Master may be burdensome, but the power you may gain is limitless, hidden behind their secrets.'

Until it started treating you like a neighbour. You know which water is safe in a dry year, which root brings a fever down and which one you never touch, where the deer go when the snow comes and why they stopped going there. And somewhere in all that quiet you learned to truly listen, until the crows and the foxes and the old boar began to answer, and it turned out they had been complaining about you for years. You have buried animals you loved. You have sheltered both fox and rabbit in your hut through an especially hard winter, and all of you parted as friends. You do not think of the place as yours. If anything, it is the other way around.'

			'**Speaker for the Wild Things.** The wild has no voice in civilization, so it asks for yours. Wherever there is green country, the inhabitants of it will find you: a magpie with a complaint, a village dog that has decided to retire from hunting and wants to shepherd, a rookery of penguins presenting a formal grievance, a whale that has stopped singing and will not start again until somebody listens. What they bring is never tidy: a spring gone sour, a track of dead things leading somewhere nobody goes, animals leaving a valley all at once, a stranger in the woods who smells like death. It always reaches you first, because you are the one they trust. Country folk who work the land know your kind on sight, and they come to you when something is wrong: a herd that will not settle, a blight in the barley, whatever has been coming down out of the trees at night. Nobody appointed you. You are simply the one who is listening.'

			"You never fought for a flag, only for a fair price and the good name that brings the next contract. Guard work, siege lines, ugly little wars: danger became just another day's labor.

In any town of decent size you can find where sellswords drink and fixers broker deals, and turn up honest paid work: a caravan that needs guarding, a patron hiring muscle for a quiet job, or an old comrade willing to stand at your back for a share. The coin is real and so is the danger, and a name earned at swordpoint calls in old debts as often as new offers.'

			'You tell fortunes for a living: palms, cards, the drift of smoke inside a glass orb you blew yourself. Most of it is craft: a sharp eye for the hope or fear a stranger walks in carrying, a patter that hands them back their own secrets dressed as prophecy, fingers quick enough to keep the trick invisible. But not all of it. Every so often a vision arrives unbidden and turns out true, and even you cannot say how you knew. You have learned not to argue with an omen when it points, and the last one pointed you toward whatever you are walking into now.'

Over ten minutes, by laying the cards, gazing into your glass, letting the pendulum swing, or any other method, you draw a single sign or omen, and nothing more: It may be a symbol (a Skull, a Key, a Spark), a sound (a raven's caw, a bell, a distant sob), a sensation (cold, chills, warm), or a glimpse of the feelings of the creature (afraid, grieving, excitement). The DM gives you the sign (expressed briefly as one or two words), never its meaning, as the meaning is yours to divine. Whether the sight is true foresight or only a sharp read of the soul before you, not even you can say. You can read a given creature only once until the creature finishes a Long Rest."

You speak for the people who have none, in taverns, in back rooms, on a crate in the market square, and a folded pamphlet finds a stranger's palm without your hands ever seeming to move. When the watch comes, you are already someone else, three alleys away. The cause has cost you a home, a name, a friend or two; it has never once cost you the belief that the world can be remade."

In any town you can find the cause's sympathizers: they will hide you, feed you, and carry your words where you cannot go. From them you learn who truly holds the town and who chafes under them, and there is always a local wrong they will beg you to help set right. Their aid is real but costly to give: every hand that shelters you risks the gallows for it."

			"Your people do not stay; they follow: the herds, the thaw, the old roads worn into the ice by generations of runners and sleds. You were born to the long cold and the long march: keep the animals alive, keep moving, keep watch, and carry nothing you can't carry yourself. You shape your own sled and tools by feel, and warmth and walls mean little to you. Now you trail a road of your own. The ice let you go, and every land since has felt thin and overwarm."

Given enough time and rough raw materials (bone, driftwood, hide, sinew, or packed snow), you can make the gear the cold demands: shelter from the storm, a sled runner, a patched harpoon. It is never pretty, but it keeps you and your companions alive where the unprepared simply die.'

			'You learned to be the thing that does not break. Whether you served a sworn order, a city watch, or a village that had no one else, the lesson never changed: put yourself between the weak and the blow, hold when others run, and mend what the fighting breaks. You drill until standing firm is instinct, keep your own gear sound, and have set more bones than you can count. Let the reckless chase glory. You would rather be the reason someone lived to see the morning.'

Wherever you go, the frightened and the cornered seem to know at a glance that you will stand for them: a hunted stranger begging sanctuary, a hamlet with no one left to defend it, a child who takes your hand because you look like safety. You can always turn them away, but you were made to be the wall between the weak and the wolves, and word of a protector spreads as fast as word of a threat.'

			'You are the mouth and the hand. A herald carries power that is not their own: a council, a temple, a patron, a forest... They chose you. Out of everyone they could have sent. And you may still wonder why. They send you where an army cannot go: your word opens gates that stay barred to soldiers, and you walk in alone, past the guards, into the room where the thing is decided. A herald who can be dismissed is worse than no herald at all, so you made yourself impossible to overlook. In any room you can tell who is listening, who is stalling, and who decided the answer before you walked in. If the talking works, you carry the treaty out, and everyone who wanted the war knows what is in your satchel. If the talking fails, you are already inside their lines, and you are the first blade they meet. Either way, it comes home with you or it does not come home at all. Any means necessary.'

They will hear you out, because harming a herald is how small quarrels become wars. In exchange, when your power sends for you, you go. You are asked more than anyone should be: taking out threats, communicating with a secret source, or even retrieving a precious artifact for the cause. You have to do anything your power requires of you. Some errands are honorable. Some are not. If you are caught, you may not enjoy your immunity any longer.'

So you went: up the scree in bad weather, into the fen at the hour the things you were after come out, down to a shoreline nobody had bothered to name, with a board across your knees and the light already going. Half of what you have catalogued has bitten you at least once. You paint fast, because nothing holds still and the weather never cooperates, and you have learned to draw a thing accurately enough that someone who has never seen it would know it anywhere. And you can make people care: give you a crowd and a specimen and you can hold them for an hour explaining why a beetle matters, why the river changed, what the shape of a wing is for. Somewhere along the way, from watching too closely for too long, you picked up a little of what you were studying. You still cannot say how. That is the trouble with the natural world: it does not stop at the edge of the page.'

Your plates and your notes are currency among them, and so is whatever you carry out of the field. A dragon's fang, a moulted celestial feather, spores from a fungus that grows in one cave in the world: what is left on the ground after a hard night is, to the right buyer, a spell component, a medicine, or the centerpiece of a collection. They pay, and they commission: a specimen of this, a drawing of that, proof that the thing the villagers keep describing is real. And somewhere out there is a creature nobody has ever drawn, which is precisely the kind of rumor that gets people killed."

You read dead languages by torchlight while something shifts in the chamber ahead, and you know the gods of the underworld by name, which is useful, because in your line of work they come up. You have seen what happens to a man who reads the wrong passage aloud, and you have read it aloud anyway, because the alternative was the ceiling coming down. You know stone: which slab is a counterweight, which floor is a lie, which wall was built to keep something in rather than someone out. You have outrun a collapse, outlasted a curse (mostly), and been certain, twice, that you would not see daylight again. You did. Something in you insists on it. Everyone says the dead should be left in peace. Everyone is probably right. You are going back down tomorrow.'

A college with a theory, a temple that wants a relic home, a collector with more money than sense, a widow with her grandfather's map: they need someone who will actually go in, and there are not many of you. So the offers come, and the rivals with them, because the same rumor reaches three expeditions at once and only one of you gets there first. The rest arrives unasked. People bring you things they should never have picked up: an amulet that will not come off, a book that is warm to the touch, a jar whose seal somebody broke. You know the signs, the old prohibitions, and roughly what is likely to come through the door tonight, which makes you the one they send for when a crypt starts making noise. Whether you can stop it is a separate question. You have always found out the hard way."

Gold to the sun, silver to the moon, iron to the red star. A stone cut on the right day and set in the right metal at the right hour does not merely decorate. It transmits something. Neither Druid nor Wizard knows of these secret arts, of metal and crystal and stone, of harvesting the power of the amethyst and the agate: the power of correspondence, not found in casting spells. Somebody initiated you into the Hermetic Art: a master with a locked cabinet, a traveling jeweler you hosted for a winter, a silent old woman working in silver to protect your village from the full moon. You have kept the tradition since, copying diagrams, runes, and circles you did not understand until the day you did. You know the great works by name and by history, every one of them, and how each was made. You understand the ciphers of nature and of the old manuals. And you know what the great secret would cost. Quinta Essentia. The Fifth Essence. The Philosopher's Stone. The one thing you still cannot produce. You will find it."

Given the materials, the hours, and a quiet bench, you can produce trinkets of great power (you must follow the rules for Crafting Magic Items). The difficulty is never skill. It is always materials. What a true piece needs cannot be bought in a market: a scale from a silvery dragon, iron that fell out of the sky and is not cold yet, quicksilver from a spring that exists in one story and no map. So you go and get them, and others come with you, and that is how half your journeys have started. Between those, the commissions find you, because somebody always wants a thing ordinary money cannot buy: a ward for a child, a signet that cannot be forged, something to stop whatever has been visiting the house at night. And somewhere ahead is the piece you have been building toward your whole life, still missing the one component you have not yet discovered.'

Whoever they were, greatness has logistics: someone has to feed the horses, mend the tack, find the ford when the bridge is out, keep the packs dry, and know exactly how many days of food are left. That was you. You learned to read your master's silences before they spoke, and to read everyone who came to them: the petitioner who was lying, the rival smiling too hard, the boy who needed sending home before the fighting started. You saw them up close, on their worst days as well as their best, and you know the part the legends leave out. You are not them. Not yet.

Their enemies count the same way. And there are always obligations left unfinished: a promise your master made and cannot keep, a rival who has been waiting for them to be gone, someone who has been writing letters for two years and getting no answer.

What survives of it survives in you: a language fewer people speak each year, a handful of songs, the way it was cooked at home, the names of people nobody here has ever heard of. You learned the roads out and the roads back, which crossings ask for papers and which guards can be talked past, because a map is not a curiosity when it is the difference between arriving and not. You learned to be spoken to badly and not answer. You also learned when not to swallow it: there is a way of standing that ends a conversation before it begins, and you can do it without raising your voice.

A back room, a barbershop, a kitchen with the tea already poured: sit down and they will ask what you need before they ask who you are. Everyone at that table has needed it. Someday you will be asked in turn, and there is no polite way to refuse. Go and sit with the old ones. Here they are invisible: no records, no standing, waiting on grandchildren to translate them at counters. They are also the last library of a world that is being forgotten. They know the true names, the rites that were made illegal, what the pattern on your grandmother's coat actually meant, where a thing was buried the week before the soldiers came. None of it was ever written down. They will tell you, if you carry their stories. Your History. And when it turns, word crosses the network in a day: a shop burned, a permit revoked, a girl taken by men who will not show the warrant, a temple reassigned to a god this country prefers. Everyone gives what they can. What you can give is worth more than the coin they could quietly take away. You are the one who can go. You could stop, of course. Speak only their language, wear only what they wear, let the stories and the gods go quiet, and in a generation nobody would know. Some of yours have.
