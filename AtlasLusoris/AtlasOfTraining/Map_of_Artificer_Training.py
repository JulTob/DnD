"""
Artificer Training Tags — 2024 core Guild lessons + all Specialties.

Thought pattern
        1. Core lessons belong to the Artificer Guild (no Specialty).
        2. Specialty lessons set path=… and awaken only for that Specialty.
        3. Infusion counts live as Chips.
        4. Artificer has no legacy Progression — all lessons live here.
