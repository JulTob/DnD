"""
Rogue Training Tags — 2024 PHB core + all Rogue Archetypes.

Thought pattern
	1. Core lessons belong to the Rogue Guild (no path).
	2. Archetype lessons set ``path=…`` and awaken only for that Archetype.
	3. Numbers (Sneak Attack dice) live as Chips and in callable Entries.
	4. ASI / Epic Boon stay on legacy Progression.
	5. Language grants (Thieves' Cant) stay in legacy.
