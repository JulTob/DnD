"""
Wizard Training Tags — 2024 PHB core + all Arcane Traditions.

Thought pattern
	1. Core lessons belong to the Wizard Guild (no Tradition).
	2. Tradition lessons set path=… and awaken only for that Tradition.
	3. Recovery levels and Portent dice live as Chips.
	4. ASI / Epic Boon stay on legacy Progression.
