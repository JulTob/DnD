"""
Ranger Training Tags — 2024 PHB core + all Ranger Orders.

Thought pattern
	1. Core lessons belong to the Ranger Guild (no Order).
	2. Order lessons set ``path=…`` and awaken only for that Order.
	3. Numbers (Favored Enemy uses) and senses (Blindsight) are Chips —
	   rendered in the sheet's left rail, not inside the Entry.
	4. Generator prose names the pick (weapons, Hunter options, Expertise).
	5. Spellcasting / Fighting Style Tags awaken for identity but stay
	   off the Features list — Spells section / Fighting Style feats own them.
	6. ASI / Epic Boon / Fighting Style picks stay on legacy Progression.
