"""
Druid Training Tags — 2024 PHB core + all Circles.

Thought pattern
	1. Core lessons belong to the Druid Guild (no Circle).
	2. Circle lessons set path=… and awaken only for that Circle.
	3. Numbers live as Chips and callables — not as separate Tag members.
	4. ASI / Epic Boon stay on legacy Progression.
