"""
Warlock Training Tags — 2024 PHB core + all Patrons.

Thought pattern
	1. Core lessons belong to the Warlock Guild (no Patron).
	2. Patron lessons set path=… and awaken only for that Patron.
	3. Invocation counts and Pact Magic slots live as Chips and callables.
	4. ASI / Epic Boon stay on legacy Progression.
