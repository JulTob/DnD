"""
Monk Training Tags — 2024 PHB core + all Monk Traditions.

Thought pattern
	1. Core lessons belong to the Monk Guild (no path).
	2. Tradition lessons set ``path=…`` and awaken only for that Tradition.
	3. Numbers (Martial Arts die, Focus Points, Unarmored Movement speed)
	   live as Chips and in callable Entries.
	4. ASI / Epic Boon stay on legacy Progression.
	5. Speed bonuses stay in legacy (character mutation).
