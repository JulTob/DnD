"""
Paladin Training Tags — 2024 PHB core + all Oaths.

Thought pattern
	1. Core lessons belong to the Paladin Guild (no Oath).
	2. Oath lessons set ``path=…`` and awaken only for that Oath.
	3. Lay on Hands pool and Channel Divinity uses live as Chips and
	   in callable Entries — not as separate Tag members.
	4. ASI / Epic Boon / Fighting Style picks stay on legacy Progression.
