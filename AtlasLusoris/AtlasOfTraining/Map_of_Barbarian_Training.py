"""
Barbarian Training Tags — 2024 PHB core + all Paths.

Thought pattern
	1. Core lessons belong to the Barbarian Guild (no Path).
	2. Path lessons set ``path=…`` and awaken only for that Path.
	3. Numbers (Rage uses, Rage damage, Weapon Masteries) live as Chips
	   and in callable Entries — not as separate Tag members.
	4. ASI / Epic Boon stay on legacy Progression.
