"""
Fighter Training Tags — 2024 PHB core + all Fighter Specializations.

Thought pattern
	1. Core lessons belong to the Fighter Guild (no path).
	2. Specialization lessons point to their Guild Shape and awaken only
	   when the Character carries that Shape.
	3. Mutable resources live as Character Records and concise Chips.
	   Full rules remain Entries.
	4. ASI / Epic Boon stay on legacy Progression.
	5. Fighting Styles stay in legacy (feat-pick workflow).
