GuildKit

Guild = a D&D class / vocation.

Why "Guild"?
        Python's word ``class`` is overloaded.  The Tag family is Guild;
        the character sheet may still say Class.  Awaken keeps
        ``char.char_class`` in sync for legacy Maps.

Thought pattern (read this before the code)
        1. Helper Tags name leanings and kit shapes in plain language —
           Wise, LightlyArmored, Martial, Mage.  They are preferences and
           kit facts, not exclusive locks.  A Wise Character leans Wisdom;
           they may still grow Strength.
        2. Build_Guild is the one construction point for a 2024 Guild chassis
           (hit die, saves, armor / weapon helpers, vocation, multiclass gains).
        3. Awaken stamps the Guild Tag, syncs the legacy primary string, and
           applies the helper Tags so later Maps can ask
           ``if char in Mage`` rather than parse class-name strings.
        4. Multiclass: a Character may carry several Guild Tags (budgeted).
           ``char.char_class`` names the *primary* Guild for legacy Maps;
           ``char.guild_levels`` records levels per Guild; ``Multiclassed``
           marks the Character when more than one Guild is present.
        5. Level lessons are Training Tags (TrainingKit) — you train in a
           Guild.  Legacy Map_of_Classes/Training still fills unmigrated ranks.

Usage
        from AtlasLusoris.GuildKit import Rogue, Apply_Guild, Join_Guild, Wise
        Rogue(char)
        assert char in Rogue and char in Guild
        assert char in Dexterous and char in Clever
        assert char.primary_ability == "DEX"
        Join_Guild(char, "Wizard", levels=2)  # multiclass dip

	``extends`` and ``crunches`` are the two description modes, and naming one

	see where the Guild stops speaking and the Specialization starts.  It is
	written per Guild rather than derived, because each one has its own word
