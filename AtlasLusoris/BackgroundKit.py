"""
BackgroundKit

One declarative construction point for every TOP Background.

Background Tags own their abilities, training, Origin Feature, narrative
Entry, and role eligibility. Pins classify each Background Tag directly:

    background_tag in Available
    background_tag in NPC_Background

The Pin Fields derive every public registry.  Adding a homebrew
Background therefore requires one ``Build_Background`` call and no parallel
choice lists.

# RECOVERY NOTE 2026-08-30 -- restored by hand; lost once already.
#
# This function was written on 2026-08-29 as one half of the Crafter / Musician
# pool fix, and was then destroyed when this file was restored from a copy that
# predated it.  It was re-applied on 2026-08-30.  Vault bytecode for
# BackgroundKit is OLDER than this fix: restoring this file from
# ``.recovery-vault`` will silently delete _still_open again.
#
# THE PAIR.  Two files, one behaviour, neither half works alone:
#
#   1. FeaturesKit     Reserved_Background_Training reserves only what a
#                      Background CERTAINLY grants, so an Origin Feat is no
#                      longer excluded from a whole Tool menu it should be able
#                      to draw from.  (Reserving the menu made the Artisan,
#                      Crafter and Entertainer Backgrounds 100% unbuildable.)
#   2. HERE            The Background, which grants its Tool AFTER the Feat and
#                      therefore knows what the Feat took, picks from what is
#                      left.  That is what keeps Artisan's one Artisan's Tool
#                      distinct from Crafter's three, giving four Tools rather
#                      than a collision.
#
# See the matching banner in ``FeaturesKit.Background_Tool_Menu`` for the full
# reasoning, including why a Precondition was rejected.
