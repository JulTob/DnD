"""
Grimoire of Backgrounds — one declarative record per Character Background.

A :class:`Background` carries the full 2024 record set — three ability scores,
an Origin feat, two skill proficiencies, one tool proficiency, and an equipment
package — alongside a **Name**, a **Description** of who the character is, and a
**Hook**: an ``Entry`` whose title and text the sheet prints as its own entry,
the benefit that is also a price.  ``roleplay`` is the post-wipe form of the
same text, glued to the description, and is kept only until every record
declares its Hook (QST-0122.3).

The record is the single authoring surface: write one ``Background(...)`` and
feed it through ``BackgroundKit.Build_Background`` (``OfficialBackgroundsKit``
re-exports this class as ``Official_Background_Record``) — no parallel lists.

When a de-coupled entry is adapted from an official Background, credit it with a
docstring comment above the definition (attribution is for maintainers, not the
generator, so it is not a record field)::

    # Based on the Background Chondathan Freebooter
    # source: Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerûn
    Vagabond = Background(
        name="Vagabond",
        ...
        )
