InvocationKit

Eldritch Invocation Tags — Warlock lessons chosen from a catalogue.
Distinct from Guild Training (class features) and Feats.

An Invocation is declared by what it *does*, not by prose about what it does.
The twenty-eight published invocations are seven shapes wearing different
spell names, so ``Build_Invocation`` takes those shapes as fields:

        at_will=MageArmor          cast it without a slot, as often as you like
        free_cast=WaterBreathing   … once, then a Long Rest
        sense="Truesight 30 feet"  a passive line on the sheet
        choose_cantrip="damage"    mark one of your cantrips as enhanced
        familiar=True              Pact of the Chain's special forms
        origin_feat=True           Lessons of the First Ones
        apply=<callable>           the escape hatch, for the genuinely bespoke

**Prerequisites are Tags, not strings.**  The 2024 text says "Prerequisite:
Pact of the Blade Invocation", so ``requires`` holds that Invocation's Tag and
the gate is ``target in requires``.  Tag membership is the question TagKit
exists to answer; comparing names against two different feature lists was a
workaround for not having asked it.

Effects land on plain Character attributes, the same way Backgrounds land
skills: ``at_will_spells``, ``free_cast_spells``, ``senses``, ``enhanced_cantrips``,
``pact_familiar``.  Nothing here simulates combat — this builds a sheet.
