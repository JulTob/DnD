"""
OrderKit — Secret Orders, collapsed one at a time.

An Order **precedes the Character**.  It is a thing already standing in the
world when someone knocks on its door, so it owns its own dice and picks its
own nature; a Character then *joins* one.  That is why the generator is
``Order(seed=...)`` and not a function of a Character.

	from AtlasLusoris.OrderKit import Order, Swear
	order = Order(seed=12)          # a house that exists whether or not anyone joins
	Swear(char, order)              # this Character is now sworn to it

Collapse order (each step narrows the next, none of them forbid anything):

	Tradition      Arcane | Divine | Primal → places, practices, safe spells
	Domains        two, unordered           → mechanics, philosophy, tension
	Facets         one face per Domain      → creed and goal
	Organization   Temple | Academy | …     → and the word then governs the prose
	Devotion       god | dragon | theorem | the dead | a river with opinions
	Name           <organization> of the <descriptor> <core>
	Perk · Sacrifice · Goal
	Feat           intuition_die · signature_magic · spells_of_the_order

Nothing here forbids a combination.  A Mercy order whose goal is a killing is
a surgeon's order that has decided what the tumour is, and it is *better* than
a safe one.  The generator states the pair and stops; the reader supplies the
reason, faster and better than any template could.
