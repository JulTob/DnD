"""
Map of Exotic Familiars — a familiar nobody else at the table has.

The eight published forms in ``Map_of_Familiars`` are fixed creatures out of
the Monster Manual.  This is the other route: the spirit is *built*, from a
creature type and a pool of traits, so what answers the summons is a slime, or
a living toy, or a drake the size of a dog, and it belongs to that character.

The shape is deliberately the one everybody already knows from monster-collecting
games.  A **type** decides the damage, the look, and which traits are even
possible; the traits are the moveset.  Nothing in the pool escalates damage,
because that is where familiars break: every trait buys a *sense*, a *movement
mode*, or a *trick*.  A familiar that flies, sees the invisible and carries
messages is a delight at any level and a threat at none.

Budget is the caster's Proficiency Bonus, and tiers gate what is reachable, so
a level 1 familiar gets two small talents and a level 17 one gets six, some of
them strange.  The numbers come from the 2023 playtest Pact Familiar, which is
the only version of these rules that scales with its caster:

	AC      10 + spellcasting modifier
	HP      5 + Warlock level, in d4 Hit Dice
	strike  2 + half Warlock level, damage by type

Naming follows the type and the look, so the sheet says what it is and what it
resembles: *Undead Familiar (ghost-like)*, *Ooze Familiar (slime-like)*.
