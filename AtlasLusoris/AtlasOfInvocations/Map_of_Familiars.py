Map of Familiars — the special forms Pact of the Chain unlocks.

Find Familiar's ordinary forms are animals.  Pact of the Chain adds eight that
are not, and a Warlock who takes the invocation is choosing one of *these*, so
the choice belongs on the sheet rather than as a list of names in a paragraph
nobody reads twice.

The choice is drawn, not enumerated: one form arrives on the sheet, the way a
Background draws one tool from the Artisan list.  But it is not drawn blind.
Each form declares an ``affinity``, and a caster whose patron matches is far
more likely to be answered by it — a Fiend patron gets an Imp long before it
gets a Sphinx of Wonder.  That is **Familial Preference**, and it is the same
idea the Find Familiar spell should use for ordinary animals.

Stat blocks are deliberately absent.  This is a sheet generator, and the eight
forms are printed in the Monster Manual; what the sheet needs is *which one
answered*, and why it would.
