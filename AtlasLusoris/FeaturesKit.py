FeaturesKit

TOP implementation of Character features / feats / invocations.

Depends on: CharactersKit.Character

Parallel to CharactersKit
	Feature  — OOP skeleton (title, description, source) carried on the Character
	Trait / Feat / Origin_Feat / Invocation — Tags applied to the Character

Parameter naming
	Imprints and helpers take char — the Character that bears the grant.
	We avoid TOP's word agent here so it is not confused with "Character
	as Agent" in prose, or with other Agent meanings in the project.

When a Tag awakens, it:
	1. builds a Feature object (plain attributes, not @Record for fixed prose)
	2. carries it onto char.features (sheet text the user reads)
	3. records stable choices

Stateful effects that require later ledgers (skills, HP) are reconciled by
Resolve_Feature_Mechanics once those ledgers exist. They never become runtime
"can_*" engine flags.

This is a generator: Tags + Feature prose are the deliverable. Capability
booleans belong to a game engine; we do not store them.

The Grimoire_of_Features factories are legacy; new grants live here.
