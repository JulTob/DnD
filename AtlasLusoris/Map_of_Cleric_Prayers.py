"""
Cleric prayers — short faith-lines for Domain voice.

The Guild's theme is **faith**: not necessarily a named god, but what the
Character puts their trust in.  A Domain is a take on that faith.  A prayer is
one sentence that names the take.

Assembly
	1. start from ``DEFAULT_PRAYERS`` (every Cleric);
	2. add ``DOMAIN_PRAYERS`` for the Domain they carry;
	3. add ``SPECIES_PRAYERS`` / ``SPECIES_DOMAIN_PRAYERS`` for their people;
	4. add ``CULTURE_PRAYERS`` and, if the Domain is known,
	   ``CULTURE_DOMAIN_PRAYERS`` (same network as gear titles);
	5. ``Pick`` one line from the assembled ledger.

Rendering: the Guild paragraph is shared; each Domain ``extends`` it with
its own mouth, and seats the drawn prayer in a sentence that is not the
same twice.

# Core fantasy: Being Watched (over) — keeping, not surveillance.
# Sell the class through that fantasy (what a Cleric *is*), not mood alone.
# Biblical / Jedi cadence: parallel clauses, open molds, invitation.
# The register comes from parallelism, parataxis and concrete images,
# never from archaic vocabulary (no thee, no shall) — that reads costume.
# The identity of the watcher stays a guess, so the mold stays open.
# Domain trickles doctrine into behavior; prayer seats at the end.
