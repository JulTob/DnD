"""
Ledger_of_Wonders — magic items, consumables, and classic adventuring wonders.

Every bonus here is a ``grants`` entry, so it is summed at read time and
disappears the moment the item is unequipped or sold. Nothing in this file
writes to a Character.

Where an item's effect is not yet mechanised (a Bag of Holding's capacity,
a Goggles' darkvision), it is carried as prose in ``description`` and left
OUT of ``grants`` — an unimplemented effect must not masquerade as a number
on the sheet.
