"""
Map_of_Gear_Proficiency — what a Character's training means for their gear.

Per Convention (Curia/Canon/Conventions.md): a ``Map_of_X`` is "data plus the
route or algorithm that resolves a task." This one does not own a Tag family —
it ROUTES between two that already have their own canonical Kit:
``AtlasLusoris.GuildKit``'s training Tags (``HeavilyArmored``, ``MartialArms``,
``FinesseArms``, …) on one side, and ``AtlasInventarium.ItemKit``'s gear Tags
(``Weapon``, ``Melee``, ``Ranged``, …) on the other.

Split out of ``GearKit`` (2026-07-31, Julio's request) because "who may use
what" is a different question from "what does this Character end up with" —
independent axes per ``Canon/TagKit-Doctrine.md``, even though one answers the
other.
