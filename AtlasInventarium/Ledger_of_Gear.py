# Julio (2026-08-05): "for jewels it should be multi, instead of carrying a
# lot of money." Coin is heavy, conspicuous and easy to lose; anyone with
# means converts the surplus into something they can wear, and the Jewelry
# slot already holds three. These grant NOTHING — their whole worth is their
# resale value, which is exactly the point.
#
# Prices follow the 2024 gemstone and art-object bands (10 / 25 / 50 / 100 /
# 250 / 750 gp), so selling one back is never a surprise.
