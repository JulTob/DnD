"""
Ledger_of_Armors — the PHB 2024 armor table, built with ``Build_Armour``.

One record per armor and the Shield. ``str_requirement``/``stealth_disadvantage``
are recorded but not yet enforced — a later quest applies the Speed penalty and
Stealth check disadvantage; Quest 1 only needs the data to exist and be queryable.
