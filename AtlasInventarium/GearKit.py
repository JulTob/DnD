"""
GearKit — loadout POLICY over the Grimoire_of_Items primitives.

Thought pattern (read this before the code)
	1. ``Grimoire_of_Items`` knows what gear IS. This module knows who gets
	   WHAT. Primitives stay policy-free so a second policy can exist:
	   ``Outfit_Player`` here, ``Outfit_NonPlayer`` later (characteristic
	   weapon, travel light, lootables) without touching the item layer.
	2. Proficiency is read from the Guild Tags the Character already carries
	   (``HeavilyArmored``, ``MartialArms``, ``FinesseArms``, …) — the
	   machine-readable training data, not string-matched class names.
	3. Every pick is drawn from a per-character seeded stream, so the same
	   seed always outfits the same way (no reroll flicker).
	4. Nothing is written that a derived read could compute. AC is never
	   stored here: ``armour_class(char, unarmoured=…)`` sums it live.

Public surface
	Outfit_Player(char)      — issue a full starting loadout
	armour_allowance(char)   — armour kinds this Character trained with
	weapon_pool(char)        — weapons this Character may wield
	may_use_shield(char)     — shield training, and whether it fits the build
	unarmoured_formula(char) — the natural no-armour AC (Unarmored Defense)
	starting_budget(char)    — gold for the initial kit
