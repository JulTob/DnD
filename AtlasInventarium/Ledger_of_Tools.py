"""
Ledger_of_Tools — the kits a tool proficiency is carried in.

A tool is authored once, in ``AtlasInventarium.ToolsKit``: its name, its
governing ability, and its Practice (the flavour, the rules, the Works of
Wonder).  This ledger adds only what a kit weighs and costs, and builds each
item from that one definition, so a rename or a merge made in ToolsKit reaches
the bag without a second list to drift (QST-0116).

A Musical Instrument and a Gaming Set are kinds, not items: every instrument
and every game is its own kit, at its own price, and a Character carries the
ones the training ledger says they know.

Data source for weights and prices: the 2024 equipment table.  Costs are held
in gold: 1 SP = 0.1 GP.
