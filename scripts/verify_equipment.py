"""
Equipment invariant harness — the ALL GREEN gate for the Starting Equipment quests.

Run:  PYTHONPATH=. STRICT_GENERATION=1 .venv/bin/python3 scripts/verify_equipment.py

Gates the GearKit system (Grimoire_of_Items + Ledgers + Crafts + the weapon
mastery bridge), which replaced the legacy Inventory as the live loadout source.

Invariants checked
	1. Ledger record integrity — value and weight are not transposed.
	2. No accidental duplicates in the bag. Consumables are EXEMPT: carrying
	   four potions is the point, not a bug.
	3. Purse is non-negative and floored to the copper piece.
	4. AC is DERIVED and agrees with what is actually worn: it never exceeds
	   best-of(worn armour, Unarmored Defence) + shield + magical grants.
	5. Body slots respect their capacity (one hat, one cloak, three rings).
	6. A Character only wields weapons their Guild trained them for, and
	   never a firearm.
	7. Armour worn is within the Guild's armour training.
	8. Unarmored Defence that armour would void (Monk, Dance) stays unarmoured.
	9. Every equipped item is actually owned.
	10. Weapon Mastery: the right COUNT, every mastered weapon is CARRIED,
	    melee-only Guilds never master a non-Thrown ranged weapon, and the
	    drills are balanced between reach and close work.
	11. No duplicate chip labels on the sheet.
	12. Generation is deterministic per seed.
