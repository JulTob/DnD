## 📔 A. The app cannot do it today (all three are in the path Decree 0004 parks behind `PLAYER_ONLY_PUBLISH`)

| # | What happens | Where | Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `summon_nonplayer` fails after five attempts on every call: the vaulted `Grimoire_of_NPC.SetSize` passes two arguments to `Map_of_Size.Size(Type)`, which takes one. The NonPlayer sheet and the DM Companion cannot summon. The running bytecode is longer than the source on disk. | `AtlasActorLudi/AtlasAlusoris/Map_of_NonPlayer_Generation.py` (shim) → vault `Grimoire_of_NPC` line 357; `AtlasActorLudi/Map_of_Size.py:32` | NPCs-and-Villains §1 |
| A2 | `Map_of_Prose_Adventure` and `Charts_of_Choice_Collapse` fail to import: they import `Locus`, `Power`, `Plan` from `Grimoire_of_Adventure`, which defines none. "Generate scene" has nothing behind it. | `AtlasEpica/Map_of_Prose_Adventure.py:23-31` | NPCs-and-Villains §1, §5 |
| A3 | `generate_npcs` calls `NPC.NPC(...)` on the class. | `AtlasAlusoris/Map_of_NPC.py:51` | NPCs-and-Villains §1 |
| A4 | **A Battle Master can fail to generate** (Player path, shipped). Student of War's untrained pick reads tool attributes off `char.skills` (`getattr(char.skills, "Woodworker_Tools")`), which holds no tools; when the seeded shuffle reaches a tool before an untrained skill, `AttributeError` becomes `TagImprintError: Imprint Build_Training.<locals>.Awaken failed`. Reproduced: Tiefling Fighter, seed 974460, levels 13 and 14. Same family as QST-0092 (Assassin). | `AtlasLusoris/AtlasOfTraining/Map_of_Fighter_Training.py:523-575` | Fighter page; this sweep |

## 📔 B. Wrong on the player sheet

| # | What happens | Where | Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Every character speaks Common and Halfling. Species and class branches compare the Character to a string (`char == "Elf"`), never true; the extra language is `set.pop()`, no dice; it is hash-ordered, so one process gave Halfling to every character and the next gave Common Sign Language. | `AtlasLudus/Map_of_Languages.py:1383-1399`, `:1325` | Sheet-Alignment-Languages §3 |
| B2 | The Celestial patron paragraph prints `Descent(kind='Star', names=(…)) of Justice`: the pick from `DESCENTS` is a record with a `names` tuple, formatted whole. | `AtlasLusoris/AtlasOfGuilds/WarlockKit.py:174-187` | Spells-and-Invocations §4 |
| B3 | A level-5 Bard knows Resurrection (level 7) and Find the Path (level 6): the baseline pool takes every level above 0, never capped by slot level. | `AtlasLusoris/Grimoire_of_Spellcasters.py:2502` | Spells-and-Invocations §2 |
| B4 | Sorcerer subclasses add no always-prepared spells (Draconic, Clockwork, Aberrant, Wild Magic); the Warlock branch has them, the Sorcerer branch has none. | `Grimoire_of_Spellcasters.py:1508-1665` | Spells-and-Invocations §2 |
| B5 | Cleric Domain spells are listed in a Feature ("3rd: …") and absent from the spell cards. | `AtlasLusoris/AtlasOfTraining/Map_of_Cleric_Training.py:511+` | Spells-and-Invocations §2 |
| B6 | Agonizing Blast, Eldritch Spear, Repelling Blast print "Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips"; the choice is recorded in `enhanced_cantrips` and never printed. Lessons of the First Ones prints "(see Origin Feats in FeaturesKit)". | `AtlasLusoris/AtlasOfInvocations/Map_of_Eldritch_Invocations.py` | Spells-and-Invocations §4; Feature-Text canon |
| B7 | Human male name lists have never fired: `MALE = "Je" in Type`. | `AtlasNomina/Races/Human.py:5` | Names §4 |
| B8 | Tieflings print a trailing space: `Fiend.Surnames` returns `[""]`. Decision pending on the family name; the space is a bug either way. | `AtlasNomina/Races/Fiend.py:961-963`; `Map_of_Names.py` default `f"{name} {surname}"` | Names §4 |
| B9 | Two Fiend names fused by missing commas (`"Honesty" "Zephyron"`, `"Honesty" "Honor"`); `Ravenwatcherg` in the Elf surname list. | `AtlasNomina/Races/Fiend.py:21`; `AtlasNomina/Races/Elf.py:391` | Names §4 |
| B10 | Story templates hard-code a pronoun ("Known for her fearless resolve … prides herself"; "channels her fighting spirit"). | `AtlasEpica/Map_of_Stories.py:845-846` | Stories-and-Titles §2 |
| B11 | Titles title-case the particles: "The Phoenix Of The Swan Shrine". | `AtlasEpica/Map_of_Titles.py:89-101` (`custom_cases`) | Stories-and-Titles §7 |
| B12 | `Noble {FullName}` for a They Noble reads as a rank. | `AtlasNomina/Map_of_Names.py` (Noble prefix branch) | Names §5 |
| B13 | Epic Boon texts abbreviated ("+1 to any ability (max 30)", "PB", "Re-charges"); "Once you use this benefit. (once per Long Rest)" is a broken sentence. | `AtlasLusoris/Grimoire_of_Features/__init__.py:303-540` | Feats §5 |
| B14 | "Intellicence" in the Ability Score Improvement feats. | `Grimoire_of_Features/__init__.py:329-339` | Feats §1 |
| B15 | Weapons print with no description (2 of 38 have one); shields are personalised, weapons are not. | `AtlasInventarium/Ledger_of_Weapons.py` | Equipment-and-Masteries §3 |
| B16 | 2014-layer leaks on class sheets: Paladin "Abjure Enemy" with literal "CHA"; Sorcerer "see PHB '24 pp145-150"; Rogue "Arcane Trickster: 3"; Druid double Primal Order; Ranger "You adopt the Hunter specialization" and duplicate Hunter's Lore; Wizard duplicate Spellbook; Monk blurbs; Bard PHB paragraphs verbatim; Fighter triple-pasted lines. | `AtlasLusoris/Map_of_Classes/Training/*.py` | each Guild page §8 |
| B17 | Guard background renders under its hook's title ("Watcher's Eye"). | background render path | Backgrounds-Official |
| B18 | Em-dashes in rules text on the sheet: 98 sites across the Training maps and feat maps (35 in `Map_of_Official_Origin_Feats.py`, 9 in `Map_of_Paladin_Training.py`, 7 in `Map_of_Druid_Training.py`); 18 features carried one across 29 swept sheets. The Dialogs call this "against the formatting law." | `AtlasLusoris/AtlasOfTraining/*.py`, `AtlasOfFeatures/Map_of_Official_Origin_Feats.py` | Feature-Text canon; Dialogs 0016, 0018 |
| B19 | Open-choice phrases ("of your choice", "Choose one/two") at 79 source sites; 35 hits across 29 swept sheets (Expertise, Otherworldly Glamour, Metamagic Options…). Some are in-play choices and stay; most are elections the generator already made. | `Map_of_General_Feats.py` (8), `Map_of_Classes/Training/Warlock.py` (7), `Map_of_Bard_Training.py` (6), `Map_of_Barbarian_Training.py` (6)… | Feature-Text canon; QST-0067 |
| B20 | "a Aasimar" in a Story ("{name} is a young {species}"): the article does not agree with a vowel. | `AtlasEpica/Map_of_Stories.py` (Archetype: "a young {species}") | Stories-and-Titles |
| F. The feats, one Questa each (2026-09-10) |
| --- |
| Every feat defect below now has its own open Questa: QST-0095 two Dark Gifts crash · QST-0096 Blessed and Druidic Warrior grant nothing · QST-0097 Magic Initiate grants nothing · QST-0098 four General feats drop a benefit · QST-0099 Strong_Arm's degraded copy is live · QST-0100 Dragon Cult Initiate's language branch · QST-0101 the General catalogue is orphaned · QST-0102 the Epic Boon map declares nothing · QST-0103 legacy Lucky crashes · QST-0104 Arcane Infiltrator does not exist · QST-0105 Boon of Truesight · QST-0106 Blind Fighting states no rule · QST-0107 the Dark Gift lines · QST-0108 the rebrands do not name what they rename · QST-0109 Field Marshal, a design question for the Agora. Resilient was already QST-0067. |

| B21 | Goliath `Fire's Burn` and `Frost's Chill` print without the rule's "can", so an optional rider reads as mandatory: *"you deal an extra 1d10 Fire damage"* where the rule is *"you can deal"*. A use would be spent on every damaging hit. Their four sibling options all keep "you can". | `AtlasActorLudi/SpeciesKit/Goliaths/` (the options' `EFFECT` strings) | Goliath chapter 0 |
| B22 | Halfling Nimbleness renders "at least one size larger than you" where the 2024 rule is "a size larger than you", a single step. The constant is named `MINIMUM_RELATIVE_SIZE`, so this may be deliberate; undeclared either way. A Small Halfling may currently move through Large, Huge and Gargantuan creatures as well as Medium. | `AtlasActorLudi/SpeciesKit/Halflings/` | Halfling chapter 0 |
| B23 | **Resilient never grants the saving-throw proficiency**, which is the entire feat. It is described and not applied: no `training=` and no `apply=`. Already named by QST-0067. | `AtlasLusoris/AtlasOfFeats/Map_of_General_Feats.py` | Feats §4 · **QST-0067 (already open)** |
| B24 | **Blessed Warrior and Druidic Warrior grant nothing.** `Build_Fighting_Style` accepts an optional `apply=` and neither declaration passes one, so each awakens as a paragraph of text with no cantrips. The legacy copy of Druidic Warrior at least sampled two Druid cantrips. | `AtlasLusoris/AtlasOfFeats/Map_of_Fighting_Styles.py` | Feats §4 · **QST-0096** |
| B25 | **Magic Initiate (Cleric, Druid, Wizard) grants nothing**: no cantrips, no level-1 spell, no use tracking. The published "you can also cast it using spell slots" and the spellcasting-ability clause are absent from the text as well. | `AtlasLusoris/FeaturesKit.py` | Feats §4 · **QST-0097** |
| B26 | Benefits silently dropped from published General feats: Athlete's Climb Speed, Dual Wielder's Quick Draw, Medium Armor Master's Stealth benefit and armour prerequisite, Ritual Caster's ritual casting. | `Map_of_General_Feats.py` | Feats §4 · **QST-0098** |
| B27 | Dragon Cult Initiate's Dragon's Tongue is half implemented: `_grant_language` is called unconditionally and de-duplicates silently, so the published "if you already know Draconic, you instead learn one language of your choice" branch never fires. | `AtlasOfFeatures/Map_of_Official_Origin_Feats.py` | Feats §4 · **QST-0100** |
| B28 | **`Strong_Arm` is defined twice and the surviving copy is the degraded one.** The dead copy carries the `<br>` before "On My Mark"; the live copy does not, so the feat prints its two sub-benefits run together. Supersedes the earlier note that recorded only the duplication. | `Map_of_Official_Origin_Feats.py` lines 864 and 2021 | Feats §6 · **QST-0099** |
| B29 | **Two Dark Gifts crash on apply.** Echoing Soul and Symbiotic Being import `STANDARD_LANGUAGES` from `AtlasLudus.Map_of_Languages`, a name that exists nowhere in the repository. Measured: 4 per cent of seeded level-1 Humans fail to generate. | `Map_of_Official_Origin_Feats.py` | Feats §6 · **QST-0095** |
| B30 | **The General feat catalogue is orphaned.** Nothing outside `AtlasOfFeats/` imports `FeatKit`, so its gated, prerequisite-checking path runs only in its own self-test. The live level 4, 8, 12 and 16 draw is `ApplyRandomFeats` in `Grimoire_of_Features`, reading a different catalogue. | `AtlasLusoris/FeatKit.py`, `Grimoire_of_Features/__init__.py` | Feats §6 · **QST-0101** |
| B31 | Legacy `Lucky()` in `Grimoire_of_Features` raises `NameError` on `char` if called: the description interpolates a Character at build time rather than at apply time. Dead today, a landmine for anyone reaching for the legacy factory. | `Grimoire_of_Features/__init__.py` | Feats §2 · **QST-0103** |
| B32 | **Arcane Infiltrator does not exist.** It is named as the Agent of the Ninth Quill's Origin feat and is implemented nowhere. | `AtlasOfBackgrounds/Map_of_Arcana_Unleashed_Backgrounds.py` | Feats §5 · **QST-0104** |

## 📔 C. Breaks the replay or the Dice doctrine

| # | What happens | Where | Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `NewName` and `Namer` seed the **global** `random` with the Character's seed. | `AtlasNomina/Map_of_Names.py:360, 368, 569, 593` | Names §1 |
| C2 | `ApplyEpicBoon` draws with `random.sample` and prints "Epic Boom!" (also line 380 for damage types). | `Grimoire_of_Features/__init__.py:555, 644-645, 380` | Feats §5 |
| C3 | Language draw by `set.pop()` (see B1): hash-ordered, not the Character's. | `Map_of_Languages.py:1325` | Sheet-Alignment-Languages §3 |
| C4 | Legacy `NPC.alignment` assigns the drawn alignment and returns a local "Neutral". | `AtlasAlusoris/Grimoire_of_NPC.py:65-77` | NPCs-and-Villains §1 |
| C5 | Legacy NPC story always empty: `SetMyStory` swallows the `TypeError` from `~npc`. | `Grimoire_of_NPC.py:529-535`; `AtlasActorLudi/Map_of_Stories.py` | NPCs-and-Villains §1 |

## 📔 D. Duplicates and dead files

| # | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | `Strong_Arm` defined twice; the second wins. | `AtlasLusoris/AtlasOfFeatures/Map_of_Official_Origin_Feats.py:864, 2021` |
| D2 | Two copies of the Titles vocabulary (9,470 and 10,049 lines). | `AtlasNomina/Map_of_Titles.py`, `AtlasEpica/Map_of_Titles.py` |
| D3 | Two copies of the Story engine (2,940 and 2,889 lines). | `AtlasActorLudi/Map_of_Stories.py`, `AtlasEpica/Map_of_Stories.py` |
| D4 | Two spell registries: 319 `Spell` instances and a 136-entry compressed dict in the same file. | `AtlasMagia/Lodge_of_Spells.py` |
| D5 | Fighting Styles defined twice. | `AtlasOfFeats/Map_of_Fighting_Styles.py`; `Grimoire_of_Features` |
| D6 | `Map_of_Epic_Boons.py` binds all twelve names to `None`, so `_EPIC_BOON_DECLARATIONS` stays empty and the entire TagKit boon path, including its real level-19 precondition, is dead. The texts that reach a sheet live in `Grimoire_of_Features`. | `AtlasLusoris/AtlasOfFeats/Map_of_Epic_Boons.py` |
| D7 | `HumanLegacy.py` (7,105 lines) imported by nothing; `Kit_of_Elvish.py` imported by nothing. | `AtlasNomina/Races/HumanLegacy.py`; `AtlasNomina/AtlasScriptum/Kit_of_Elvish.py` |
| D8 | Monk Focus techniques live in the Lodge of Spells. | `Lodge_of_Spells.py:7083+` |
| D9 | Orphaned `("greece", …)` prayer keys; two dead keys, six silent markers, three broken lines. | `Map_of_Cleric_Prayers.py` (Cleric page) |
| D10 | `Documenta/Sources/Jedi` cited by the Psi Warrior commentary is gone. | Fighter page |
| D11 | Rogue legacy Training adds two `AddAnyLanguage` calls (2024 grants one). | `AtlasLusoris/Map_of_Classes/Training/Rogue.py:49-51` |
| D12 | The design documents live in two trees: `Curia/` (188 files; Decrees 0001-0004, 0007, 0008; Agentia, Consuls, Vademecum) and `Documenta/` (133 files; Decrees 0005-0006; Sources; this Mythos). Decree 0002, cited by code and Questae as the Dice doctrine, resolves only in `Curia`. | `Curia/Agora/Decrees/0002-character-root-and-dice.md` |

## 📔 E. Design gaps that read as defects (decisions, not bugs)

| # | What | Page |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | The written backgrounds have zero gates in the Story engine; the story never reads the hook. | Stories-and-Titles §3 |
| E2 | Species Goals and Origins in the Story engine contradict the canon (bloodline curse, celestial mission, silver dragon, scattered clans, old hatreds). | Stories-and-Titles §4 |
| E3 | The Celestial NPC table is the 2014 canon; "Tiefling" is a Fiend kind. | NPCs-and-Villains §2 |
| E4 | Spell draws uniform; invocations ignore the patron. Decree 0005 §1 says affinity weights what a character receives; this is the largest selection it does not yet weight. | Spells-and-Invocations §2-4 |
| E5 | No wonder is ever bought (purse ~30 gp at every level). | Equipment-and-Masteries §2 |
| E6 | A third of player characters Evil by uniform draw. | Sheet-Alignment-Languages §2 |
| E7 | Dark Gift docstrings are the lines and never reach the sheet. | Feats §3 |
| E8 | Draconic Sorcerer draws no ancestry; Wild Magic Surge table absent. | Sorcerer page |
| E9 | Goliath `son` patronymic; Elf surnames off-culture; Halfling food names. | Names §4 |

## 📔 G. The random sweep (30 seeds, 2026-09-08)

Thirty random species × Guild × level × seed summons: 29 generated, 1 crashed
(A4). Across the 29 sheets: 35 open-choice hits (B19), 18 em-dash features
(B18), 11 titles with capitalised particles (B11), 9 empty Darkvision entries
(the chip-only convention, README open item), 3 bare stat abbreviations (B16),
2 pronoun mismatches on They characters (B10), 2 Tiefling names ending in a
space (B8), 1 book reference (B16), 1 "a Aasimar" (B20). The sweep script lives
in the session scratchpad, not the repository. A second sweep of sixty seeds at
levels 3 to 20 generated 60 of 60, so the Battle Master failure (A4) is
seed-dependent: about one in ninety across the two sweeps.

## 📔 How this ledger was made

Every A and B row was reproduced from generated output in this worktree
(`summon_player`, `summon_nonplayer`, `spellcaster`, the Story and Title
composers), then traced to source. C and D rows were read in source. E rows are
design findings whose pages carry the argument. Verification commands used are
recorded in the session; the dump scripts live in the session scratchpad and
are not part of the repository.

## 📔 F. Where a Questa already exists

| Ledger row | Questa | Note |
|---|---|---|
| A1, A3 | QST-0075 Restore the NonPlayer public surface; QST-0084, QST-0085, QST-0086 Unhide NPC Generator / List, Wire DM tools; QST-0093.7 the Player path off legacy Alusoris; QST-0079 vault survey | The `Size` call is the concrete blocker none of them names yet. |
| A2 | QST-0086 Wire DM/Magistratum Tools | The missing `Locus`/`Power`/`Plan` are the concrete blocker. |
| B2 | QST-0054 Warlock patron features are a 2014/2024 mixture | The `Descent` repr is new; so is the 2014 Genie patron (Dao, Djinni, Efreeti, Marid) still drawn in `Grimoire_of_Spellcasters.py:2270-2310`, which QST-0054 does not yet name. |
| B3 | QST-0071 Wizard spell counts ignore the Wizard table; QST-0059 verify spell texts | The Bard's cap is the sibling defect. |
| B5, B6 | QST-0057 Granted spells belong in the Magic section; QST-0069 feat-granted spells; QST-0067 Chef and Resilient must resolve, record and print their choices | The enhanced cantrip is the same rule as QST-0067. |
| B8 | **QST-0052 Generated names can carry a trailing space** | Open already; the Fiend empty surname is the cause. |
| B16 | QST-0051, QST-0055, QST-0062, QST-0094 (voice); QST-0054 (Warlock) | The 2014 leaks per Guild page. |
| Species inspiration lines (every people page) | QST-0094 Species entries speak the rulebook's present voice ("inspiration lines and two conventions await the author") | The lines drafted on the people pages belong in that Questa's lane. |
| B15 | QST-0060 Sheet presentation; QST-0046.12 re-evaluate the item system | |
| C1, C2, C3 | QST-0089 Monk and Ranger training Maps call `random`; QST-0016.6.1 seeded replay | Three more global-`random` sites. |
| C5 | QST-0077 `Map_of_Stories.Name()` silently failed on every character | The NPC branch of the same silence. |
| D12 | QST-0093.9 Station 9: one Documenta | Decree 0002 is in `Curia`. |
| E1 | QST-0064.1 Practices as Adventure Hooks | Adjacent: hooks as engine inputs. |
| E3 | QST-0050 A CelestialKit shared by Player Species and the NPC generator | The Ideal × Descent proposal is that Kit's content. |
| E5 | QST-0046.9 Starting wealth tracks the money-per-level curve; QST-0046.10 worn wealth | |
| Orders voice | QST-0061 The Order background: too many entries, and the voice is off | |
| B1, B7, B9, B10, B11, B12, D1-D8 | none found | New. |
