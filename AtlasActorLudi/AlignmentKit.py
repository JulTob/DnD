AlignmentKit

Alignment is a two-axis Geometry:

	Morality: Evil → Neutral → Good
	Order:    Lawful → Neutral → Chaotic

Neutral is the unmarked starting point. A Character carries only the axis
Tags that add meaning; Alignment derives the familiar format view from
their membership.

Evil, in this context, means antisocial behaviours. Their goals align only with personal benefit.
Good, in this context, means prosocial behaviours. Their goals sacrifice personal needs in favor of the collective, or the greater good, or the benefit of others.

Lawful, in this context, means inclined towards organizations and structures.
Chaotic, in this context, means inclined towards individualism and personal responsibility.

These tags influence further decisions, like titles, story beats, and motivation.
