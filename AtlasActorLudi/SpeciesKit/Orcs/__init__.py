		"""Orcs. The children of the horizon. Our people were on the plains first. Then the dwarves came for the gold underneath, the humans came to call it discovery, and the elves promised trade and brought curses. No orc was asked.

The old wisdom says the plains are open to everyone, and riders must travel. Now all orcs are riders and no camp is safe. The new peoples fence the plains and attack when our beasts pass through the old ways. We are called raiders instead of riders. We ride further. Together, and stronger. Every soul walks a wind path, and we orcs carry our own through the storm. If we fall, we carry on.

Orcs have tight communities. Think of why {name} left the Orc Camp, and what would bring them back."""
