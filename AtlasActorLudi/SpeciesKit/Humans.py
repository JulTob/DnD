In worlds full of monsters, magic, and dangers, our people learned not just to survive but to thrive. And it is all thanks to the power of friendship. We befriend most species, and coexist with them. We trade, we help each other, we build relationships and even marriages. Humans tend to organize, making institutions and orders part of our legacy. There is always a human "kingdom" a couple of days' walk away.
