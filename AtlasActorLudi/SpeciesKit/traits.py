	"""
	State the shared Darkvision rules at one resolved range.

	The 2024 glossary reads: "you can see in Dim Light within a specified range
	as if it were Bright Light and in Darkness **within that range** as if it
	were Dim Light. You discern colors **in that Darkness** only as shades of
	gray."  Both scopes are load-bearing, and an earlier wording lost both: the
	range never reached the Darkness clause, which promised unlimited darkvision
	in true Darkness, and the colour limit was unscoped, which claimed a Dwarf
	could not tell red from blue at noon.

	The Disadvantage note is not in the glossary's Darkvision entry.  It follows
	from Darkness-seen-as-Dim-Light being Lightly Obscured, and it is worth
	printing because a player reading this sheet will otherwise assume darkvision
	cancels the penalty.  It is scoped to that Darkness for the same reason the
	other two are: it does not apply to the Dim Light you are seeing as Bright.
