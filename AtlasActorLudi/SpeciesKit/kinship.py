"""
Kinship Tags: what a Character *resembles*, which is never what the rules call
them.

``Creature_Type`` in ``bases`` answers the rules question, and for every
playable Species the answer is ``Humanoid``: an Aasimar is not a Celestial, and
a spell that seeks Celestials does not find one.  This answers the other
question, the one every flavour system actually asks.  Aasimar take their names
from Celestials.  Gnomes get read as Fae whether or not they have ever seen the
Feywild.  A Goliath is spoken of the way giants are spoken of.

Kinship is carried as a Tag rather than as a field because that is exactly what
a Tag is for.  A Species declares its kin as a base, and nothing has to keep a
list of which Species happen to be celestial-ish.  Nothing here grants
anything: no Resistance, no sense, no trait.  It is classification, for names,
titles, gear vocabulary and familiar affinity.

**These share their names with the Creature Types deliberately.**  TagKit
resolves ``"Celestial" in character`` by Tag *name*, so an Aasimar passes every
flavour filter that asks for the word, while ``character in
bases.Celestial`` stays False and no spell that seeks Celestials finds one.
The word is the vibe; the class is the rule; only one of them is load-bearing
for the game.  Import these under a ``Kin_`` alias wherever both trees are in
scope, so the reader can tell which question is being asked.
