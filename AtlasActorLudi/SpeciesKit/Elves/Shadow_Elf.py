"""
The Shadow Elf Heritage Shape.

Published as the Shadowmoor Elf in *Lorwyn: First Light*.  Renamed here because
the setting already has a Shadow realm of its own: the Shadow Background calls
it the place where the Fae are made of dream and shadows are made of nightmare,
and these are the elves who live on that side of it.

Our skin is some shade of grey, including perfect white and pitch black, and our eyes are all white. When hardship comes, we consult the oracles and mystics, and the wise Monks who follow the way of Shadows."""
